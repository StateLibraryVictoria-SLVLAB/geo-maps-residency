# geo-maps-residency
Work related to the Creative Technologist in Residence for Oct-Dec 2025, held by Tim Sherratt. The residency explores the potential of geo-referencing and metadata within the Library’s map collections.

## Work-in-progress

### Parish maps

- [Process parish maps data](process_parish_maps.ipynb) – I wondered if it was possible to generate approximate bounding boxes from the available metadata. This notebook documents that process.
- [Parish maps browser](parish_maps_browser.ipynb) – This notebook displays information about the SLV's collection of parish maps on a modern basemap. It's mainly intended as a way of visualising the results of my efforts to create bounding boxes from the available metadata.
- [Visualise parish maps bounding boxes](parish_maps_visualise_bounds.ipynb) – This notebook visualises the results of my attempts to create bounding boxes for the SLV's collection of parish maps by putting all the bounding boxes on a modern base map. 
- [parish_maps_final.csv](parish_maps_final.csv) – dataset generated by the 'Process parish maps' notebook and used in the visualisation notebooks
