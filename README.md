# geo-maps-residency
Work related to the Creative Technologist in Residence for Oct-Dec 2025, held by Tim Sherratt. The residency explores the potential of geo-referencing and metadata within the Library’s map collections – see the [full list of outputs](https://slv.wraggelabs.com).

## Parish maps

### Notebooks

- [Process parish maps data](process_parish_maps.ipynb) – I wondered if it was possible to generate approximate bounding boxes from the available metadata. This notebook documents that process.
- [Parish maps browser](parish_maps_browser.ipynb) – this notebook displays information about the SLV's collection of parish maps on a modern basemap. It's mainly intended as a way of visualising the results of my efforts to create bounding boxes from the available metadata
- [Visualise parish maps bounding boxes](parish_maps_visualise_bounds.ipynb) – this notebook visualises the results of my attempts to create bounding boxes for the SLV's collection of parish maps by putting all the bounding boxes on a modern base map
- [Load parish maps data into an SQLite database](load_parish_maps_to_db.ipynb) 

### Datasets

- [parish_maps_final.csv](parish_maps_final.csv) – dataset generated by the 'Process parish maps' notebook and used in the visualisation notebooks

## Sands & MacDougall directories

### Notebooks

- [Download Sands and Mac PDFs and OCR text](download_sands_and_mac_pdfs.ipynb) – this notebook was used to download data from the Sands & Mac directories so I could create a fully-searchable version
- [Load data from the Sands and Mac directories into an SQLite database (for use with Datasette)](load_sands_and_mac_into_datasette.ipynb) – this notebook creates an SQLite database and accompanying metadata file that can be published online using Datasette

## Newspapers

### Notebooks

- [Download newspaper records from the SLV catalogue](download_newspapers.ipynb) – this notebook downloads the results of a search for Victorian newspapers from the State Library of Victoria's catalogue
- [Process newspaper data](process_newspapers.ipynb) – this notebook adds place information to a harvest of newspapers titles from the SLV catalogue, it also compares the catalogue records with the digitised Victorian newspapers in Trove and links or adds Trove data if missing
- [Get placenames from newspaper titles](get_places_from_newspapers.ipynb) – this notebook looks for place names in the titles of digitised newspapers from Trove, matches the names to the VicNames dataset, and adds the place coordinates
- [Load newspaper data to Datasette/Spatialite](load_newspapers_to_sqlite.ipynb) – this notebook loads the dataset created by the process newspaper data notebook into an SQLite database so it can be deployed online using Datasette and Spatialite, separate linked tables are created for titles and places

### Datasets

- [`newspapers.ndjson`](newspapers.ndjson) – newspaper records harvested from SLV catalogue
- [`newspaper_manual_additions.csv`](newspaper_manual_additions.csv) – manually created links between catalogue records and Trove newspapers
- [`newspapers_with_locations.csv`](newspapers_with_locations.csv) – newspaper records from SLV catalogue matched with place data from VicNames
- [`newspapers_combined.csv`](newspapers_combined.csv) – newspaper records from SLV catalogue combined with missing Trove newspaper data

## Images

### Notebooks

- [Harvest details of images related to Victorian places from the SLV catalogue](download_place_images.ipynb) – this notebook harvests a sample of images that relate to Victorian places from the SLV catalogue

### Datasets

- [`place_images.csv`](place_images.csv)
- [`place_images.json`](place_images.json) – organised with placename as key for easy lookups
